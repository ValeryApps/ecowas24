Alexander Cummings a affirmé que tous les leaders religieux et leurs fidèles, en tant que membres de la société au sens large, sont aussi soumis à la règle des gouvernements élus et subissent également les conséquences des mauvaises gestions.</p><p>Le numéro un de la CPP s’est exprimé lors d'une rencontre avec plusieurs chefs d’églises à Mew-Géorgia, Caldwell. Plus d’une centaines de chefs religieux y ont pris part, la plupart d’entre eux étant issus des églises pentecôtistes et baptistes du comté de Lower Montserrado.</p><p>M. Cummings a dit que l'administration du président George Weah a lamentablement échoué et déçu le peuple libérien, dégradé la présidence, volé la richesse de la nation. Il a ainsi appelé l'Église à ne peut pas fermer les yeux sur la détérioration de la situation économique du peuple et chercher à faire réélire le président actuel pour un second mandat. .</p>",
